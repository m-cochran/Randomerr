<script>
  // Get the element where the date will be displayed
  const dateElement = document.getElementById('current-date');

  // Create a new Date object (defaults to the current date and time)
  const today = new Date();

  // Define options for formatting the date
  const options = { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' };

  // Format the date using toLocaleDateString, which handles different locales
  const formattedDate = today.toLocaleDateString('en-US', options); // 'en-US' for English (United States) format

  // Update the text content of the HTML element
  dateElement.textContent = formattedDate;

  // Example for a different format (e.g., "MM/DD/YYYY")
  // const anotherFormat = today.toLocaleDateString('en-US'); // Defaults to short date format like 6/26/2025
  // console.log(anotherFormat);

  // Example for year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD)
  // const yyyymmdd = today.toISOString().slice(0,10); // "2025-06-26"
